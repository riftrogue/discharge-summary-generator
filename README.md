# 🏥 Discharge Summary Generator – AI-Powered (Prototype)

This is a **work-in-progress AI-powered Discharge Summary Generator** intended for future use **within hospital environments**.  
It’s designed to connect to a hospital’s internal system and fetch structured patient data — such as diagnosis, vitals, medications, and procedures — to generate professional discharge summaries using AI.

> ⚙️ Currently under development and **not yet connected to any real hospital database**.
